# Do As I Do (previously known as Infectious Emotions)

Theme: It's spreading

Idea: You can shoot arrows that will control the person's emotions, and you can control them.
Originally had ideas for different emotions (i.e. love = follow you, hate = move away from you)

Didn't have enough time to implement everything I wanted

Time spent: ~1 week-ish in between work
